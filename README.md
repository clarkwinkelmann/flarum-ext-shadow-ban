This extension implements shadow ban and content deletion for Flarum.

When a discussion or post is shadow hidden, only the author and users with permission "Shadow hide discussions and posts" will see it.

A user can be shadow banned for a given duration via their profile.
When a user is shadow banned, all their new discussions and posts are automatically shadow hidden.
They are **not restored** when the shadow ban ends.

Optionally you can enable the users to be shadow hidden when shadow banned.
When a user is shadow hidden, their profile will no longer be accessible by direct link and they won't be offered in search and mention auto-completion.

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-shadow-ban
